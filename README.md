# Hello
## Welcome to my 'Random Sports Advice' application

This was a portfolio project (called 'Mixed Messages') on Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer Career Path. I created this in December 2022. The instructions were to create a program that, when ran, would generate a random string of text. That was pretty much the only requirement. The rest was left up to me.

After a little thought, I decided to make program that would behave like a stranger at a sports bar who would give you random thoughts on sports. One of the objectives was to add many variables to it. So I programmed this stranger to give one of five types of responses.

* A Betting Response - where the stranger will say he has a random amount of money placed on a random top team to win it all.
* An Underdog Response - where the stranger will say he thinks a random underdog team will do well, and give a random outcome of how far they'll go.
* An Overrated Team Response - where the stranger will say he thinks a random good team will fall short of expectations, and give a random outcome of how soon their season will end.
* A Chalk Pick Response - where the stranger will say a random good team is unbeatable this year.
* An 'I don't know' response - where the stranger says we probably don't want his advice, as if he's been wrong a lot lately.

After initially developing it just for NFL teams, I added functionality to include the NBA, MLB and NHL. Inserting one of the four leagues into the randomSportsAdvice function will generate a response based on the chosen sport.
